# Image-Compression
An Image compression technique using Huffman Encoding.

Huffman code generation is implemented in detail in **main.java**.

Huffman encoding for image compression is implemented in python (**huffman.ipynb**). Achieved around 50-55% compression efficiency for images with imbalanced pixel distribution count, and the effieciency goes down for images with more balanced histogram.
